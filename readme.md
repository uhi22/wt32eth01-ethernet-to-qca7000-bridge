# Ethernet to SPI bridge using WT32-ETH01

## Goal

This project intends to use the ESP32-based WT32-ETH01 board
to build a bridge between Ethernet and the SPI of
a Qualcomm QCA7000/7005.

## News / Change history / functional status

### 2025-10-09 Ethernet migrated to later IDF version

compiles and sees incoming traffic from ethernet

## Todos
- [ ] find pins for SPI
- [ ] implement routing from Ethernet to SPI
- [ ] implement routing from SPI to Ethernet
